# Contributing

Skills for this repository follow the [Agent Skills open standard](https://agentskills.io). See the [specification](https://agentskills.io/specification) for the full format reference.

## Skill Format

Structure each skill as a folder under `skills/` with a `SKILL.md` file:

```
skills/
  your-skill-name/
    SKILL.md              # Required
    references/           # Optional: additional docs loaded on demand
    scripts/              # Optional: utility scripts
    assets/               # Optional: static resources (templates, data files)
```

### SKILL.md requirements

- **YAML frontmatter** with `name` (letters, numbers, hyphens only; 64 chars max) and `description` (1024 chars max).
- **`metadata.version`** using [semver](https://semver.org/) (e.g. `"1.0.0"`). Bump the version in every PR that changes skill content. CI enforces this.
- **`description`** in third person. Describe what the skill does and when to use it. Include keywords that help agents match tasks. Don't summarize the skill's workflow.
- **Body** under 500 lines. Split into reference files if approaching this limit.
- **Reference files** one level deep from SKILL.md—no nested references.
- **Forward slashes** in all file paths.

## Guiding Principles

**The context window is a public good.** Only add what the agent doesn't already know. Challenge every paragraph: does its token cost justify its value?

**Concise over verbose.** Claude is smart. Provide domain-specific knowledge and patterns, not general explanations.

**Consistent terminology.** Choose one term for each concept and stick to it throughout the skill.

**Don't couple skills to specific tool names.** Reference HA concepts and REST APIs instead of naming specific MCP tools (e.g. `ha_rename_entity`, `ha_get_integration`). Tool names change and not all agents have the same toolset; the underlying HA APIs and concepts are stable.

**No opinionated conventions.** Skills in this repo are applied to any HA installation. Naming conventions, code style preferences, and other user-space opinions belong in a personal skill or instance-level `CLAUDE.md`, not here. Only include guidance that reflects official HA behaviour or well-established community consensus.

## Reporting Skill Problems

When a skill misleads your agent — broken dashboards, failed automations, wrong configurations — first search existing issues for the same skill and failure. If a matching issue exists, react with thumbs-up or comment with additional context. Otherwise, open a new issue with the **Report Bad Skill Advice** template. Let the agent fill it out — it holds the full context and can trace the failure to its source in the skill.

The template covers five sections: context, timeline, root cause, impact, and environment. A thorough report gives maintainers everything they need to fix the skill in one pass.
