An **Agent Skill** is a plugin that teaches AI coding agents best practices for a specific technology, delivered as a portable Markdown knowledge pack.

This repository provides an Agent Skill for Home Assistant, following the open [Agent Skills standard](https://agentskills.io/specification). Install a skill and your agent gains Home Assistant best practices that persist across sessions.

## Included Skill

**[home-assistant-best-practices](skills/home-assistant-best-practices/):** Native HA constructs over templates, helper selection, automation modes, Zigbee button patterns, device control best practices, YAML-only integration management, dashboard configuration, and safe refactoring.

## Installation

### Agent Skills installer

Requires [Node.js 18+](https://nodejs.org/).

```bash
npx skills add homeassistant-ai/skills
```

Works with AI coding agents that support the [Agent Skills standard](https://agentskills.io): Claude Code, Cursor, Copilot, VS Code, Gemini CLI, and others. To update: `npx skills update`

### Claude Code plugin
